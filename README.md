# Bootstrap-Portfolio
My portfolio styled with bootstrap.

I reformatted the code so that there would be minimal inline CSS and no linked CSS file.  It took a lot of trial and error but I was able to try different settings with the NavBar, body, container and footer. 

Still had to use inline CSS to change font, set image dimensions and set up sticky footer.
